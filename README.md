# Situational-Tweets-Extraction-using-ML-and-NLP-approach
This project aims to extract situational information from tweets using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to identify tweets that contain specific information about different situations, events, or incidents, enabling users to filter and analyze relevant tweets based on their interests.

# Things to Remember
<li> Data used is in the form of text data.
<li> Model used for classification - SVC, Logistic Regression & Random Forest.
<li> As a result, a collection of all situational tweets are produced and shown.
<li> Single Features (tweets text) and Multiple Features (tweets text, location, and Date&time), both are taken into consideration for model building.
<li> Try to fetch tweets in real-time using Twitter's API keys and tokens. You can refer to file name <i> "Tweet_Extraction_Web_App.ipynb" </i>
  
# <h2> Project Overview
In today's world, social media platforms like Twitter serve as a massive source of real-time information. Extracting situational tweets can be beneficial for various applications, such as disaster management, event monitoring, sentiment analysis, and trend analysis. This project focuses on developing an ML and NLP-based approach to extract situational tweets using a given dataset, as well as retrieving real-time tweets from Twitter's server for emergency responders and real-time analysis.

# <h2> Features
<li> Preprocessing and cleaning of tweet data
<li> Categorizing tweets along sentiments
<li> Implementation of ML and NLP techniques for classification
<li> Evaluation of model performance

# <h2> Data Preprocessing
Before applying ML and NLP techniques, the tweet data undergoes preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for the model. The preprocessing steps include:

<li> Text cleaning: Removing special characters, URLs, and irrelevant symbols.
<li> Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
<li> Stopword removal: Filtering out common words that do not contribute much to the overall meaning.
<li> Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.

# <h2> Machine Learning Models
This project utilizes various ML models for tweet classification, such as:

<li> Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
<li> Random Forest
<li> Logistic Regression

# <h2> Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the ML models, we use standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# <h2> Results
Provide insights and results obtained from the project here. Include any interesting findings,visualizations, or comparisons of different models or approaches.
